# scripts
One of our current project is a unified corporate development environment, likely based on Ubuntu or one of its derivatives. To that end, we are working on making a few scripts that will simplify our lives and allow for easier workflow.

To use, add the scripts to /usr/bin and run chmod to allow use. Get chance and luck!
